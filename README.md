# IN4 Capstone Project 1 - Group A

In this project we create an interactive quiz game using Python as a group.
The game presents a series of questions to a player, tracks their score, and
provide feedback on their performance. The player will be able to select their
answers and receive immediate results. This project is a way to practice Python
programming concepts and engage users in an educational and entertaining game
experience.
